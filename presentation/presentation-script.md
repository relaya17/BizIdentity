## üö® **The Problem (3 minutes)**

**"Let me paint you a picture of the current business card industry:"**

**"Every year, 10 billion business cards are printed worldwide. That's enough to circle the Earth 4 times!"**

**"But here's the shocking truth: 88% of these cards end up in the trash within a week."**

**"Think about it - we're spending billions of dollars on something that becomes waste almost immediately."**

**"The problems are clear:**

- **Expensive** - $50+ for a box of 500 cards
- **Wasteful** - 88% thrown away
- **Static** - Can't update information
- **No analytics** - No idea who's looking at your card
- **Environmental impact** - Millions of trees cut down annually"

**"This is a $50 billion industry that's stuck in the past."**
